                       SLEEPALERT
This is an android based drowsiness detection system . We
have developed a Smartphone based application which monitors the
eyes of the driver and alerts the driver when they closes their eyes for
more than 1.5 seconds. Front camera of the Smartphone is used to
monitor the face of the user in real time. Drivers need to have mobile
stands for vehicles to use the system in real world.
