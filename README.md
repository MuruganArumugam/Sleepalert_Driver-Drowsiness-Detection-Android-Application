                       SLEEPALERT
This is an android based drowsiness detection system . We
have developed a Smartphone based application which monitors the
eyes of the driver and alerts the driver when they closes their eyes for
more than 1.5 seconds. Front camera of the Smartphone is used to
monitor the face of the user in real time. Drivers need to have mobile
stands for vehicles to use the system in real world.

Requirements :- 

Hardware
• Android Device with minimum sdk 21
• Mobile stand for vehicles

Software
• Android studio

Steps to run the app are the following.
• Zip file(sleepalert_final.zip) is uploaded. Download the zip file
and extract it in some location
• Open android studio and choose "Open an existing Android
Studio project" option
• Then specify the extracted zip file location and click on it
• It will take some time for the gradle to build
• Once gradle build is finished, connect your android device
through usb and choose your device name ( make sure you have
enabled the developer options in your mobile )
• Click run icon
• Now the application will run in your android device
